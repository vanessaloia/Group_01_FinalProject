/*
* \file LIS3DH_Registers.h
* \header file for the configuration of accelerometer registers 
* \this file contains, for all the registers of the LIS3DH accelerometer used in this project:
* \-the definition of the register address
* \-the definition of the content written in the register at the first start up configuration (if the register is written)
* \accelerometer registers are non volatile so they are all configured only at the first start up
* \control register 1 and 4 are then changed at runtime according to the user settings
